"""Tests for command-line dev file parameter.

These tests invoke the actual application script (src/apple_health_analyzer.py) as a subprocess
to validate the CLI argument parsing and application startup behavior. This approach tests the
real application code path that users would experience when running the application, rather than
testing argument parsing in isolation with mock implementations.

The tests verify:
1. Help output includes all expected CLI options
2. Invalid file paths cause immediate failure with non-zero exit codes
3. Valid file paths allow the application to start successfully
